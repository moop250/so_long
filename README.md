## Description

so_long is a 2D map-based game project. The goal is to make a playable character that must collect all collectibles and reach the exit with the fewest moves possible.

## Base Features
  
- **Graphics:** Implements a basic text-based graphic engine to display the game on screen.
- **User Input:** Handles user input for movement and exiting the game.
- **Move Counter:** Keeps and displays a count of total moves made.
- **Map Format Validation:** Ensures the map is well structured and follows the specified formation rules.

## Bonus Functionality

The bonus part of pipex enhances the basic functionality with the following features:

- **Animations:** Enhanced the graphics by including animations for character and collectable sprites.
- **Enemies:** Presence of enemies in the map which can end the game if they touch the player.
- **Move Counter (but better):** Displays the current amount of moves on the screen instead of in the shell.

Compilation & cleanup:

- `make` : Compiles the standard code.
- `make all` : Compiles both the standard and bonus code.
- `make clean` : Cleans up object files in the libraries (.o).
- `make fclean` : Cleans up all files generated by running make, including the executable.
- `make re` : Does a make fclean followed by a make to recompile all the code.

Example usage of so_long:
